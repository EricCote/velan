#Instructions


Bonjour Velan!

After you left on Friday, our virtual machines were taken down before I could save the reports to the web. The network admin needed the space to prepare this week's courses. After you left, he didn't know I was still working on your stuff. Our bad!

I am preparing a new version of the "translation" sample, which is the most interesting sample. It should be up this afternoon. 

I can recreate a few other samples if you need to.  


Step for the Translation samples:

## Adventure Works install

Get Adventure Works here:

Adventure Works 2014: 
https://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/downloads/get/880661

Adventure Works DW 2014:
https://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/downloads/get/880664

You'll need to unzip and restore the backups.  

*Note:* there are different versions of Adventure Works.  You can install an older version of Adventure Works on a newer version of Sql Server, but not the other way around.  (I.E.: You can install Adventure Works 2012 on SQL Server 2014, but not Adventure Works 2016.) 

## Other steps

1. You need SSDT BI 2014 if you don't have it installed. Here is a link.

2. You need to create the tables from tables.sql

3. To be continued
